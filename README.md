Learning how to eat healthy and making a lifestyle change is overwhelming and difficult. There is a lack of education and many new habits that need to be developed which deter people from meeting their health goals. Reading food labels to track calories and other nutritional factors is tedious and time-consuming.

# APIs

## Auth0

Auth0 is one of the most widely respected identity providers currently operating, despite some recent shifts towards Okta.  Auth0 is much better supported by Next.js which is otherwise incompatible with Okta due to technical conflicts caused by the way Next.js handles routes.

## Edamam Food Database API

At it's core, Nutrivurv is based around the globally recognized, industry-leading Edamam Food Database collection.  Data from two of these comprehensive databases is then used to generate a wide variety of custom user-requested calculations.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products
